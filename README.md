The Mercadona Price Tracker is a Python-based web scraper that allows users to track the prices of products sold by the Spanish supermarket chain, Mercadona. This project consists of two main parts: scraping all the products in the Mercadona website and extracting the user's order history to visualize price changes per product.

## Features
 - Scrapes all products from the Mercadona website along with their details (name, price, category, subcategory, etc.).
 - Extracts the user's order history from the Mercadona website, which includes the list of products ordered along with their corresponding price and quantity.
    - Assigns product codes to the products in the user's order history by matching them with the codes of the scraped products.
    - Calculates the price per unit for each product in the user's order history.
 - Visualizes the price changes per product over time.
